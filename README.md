Avalonia Inside reduces the complexity of mobile/desktop application development by providing the fundamental features that most applications require, including:

    A single place to describe the visual hierarchy of an application.
    A common navigation user experience.
    A URI-based navigation scheme that permits navigation to any page in the application.
